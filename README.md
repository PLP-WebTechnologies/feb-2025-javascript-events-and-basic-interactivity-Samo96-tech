# FinTech Interactive Demo

Welcome to the FinTech Interactive Demo project! This simple webpage showcases how to use JavaScript to create interactive elements, listen for user events, and perform form validation.

## What It Does

- **Event Listeners:**  
  The page responds to user interactions. For example, clicking the "Change Text" button updates a message on the page instantly.

- **Form Validation:**  
  The sign-up form checks that the user enters a full name, a valid email, and a password with at least 6 characters. If any field is invalid, an error message appears next to it.

- **Dynamic Interactions:**  
  Aside from form validation, the page dynamically updates content based on user actions, making the experience interactive and engaging.
